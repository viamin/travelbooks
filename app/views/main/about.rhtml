<h1>About TravelerBooks.com</h1>

<h3>What is this all about?</h3>
<p>TravelerBooks was created to allow you to give someone a gift - a gift that is meant to be given again and again - and watch that gift continue to travel from person to person around the world. </p>

<p>These books are meant to be informal travel journals that you can bring with you on your trips and give to someone either when you're on the road or when you come back.</p>
