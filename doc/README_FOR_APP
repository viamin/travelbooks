Need to change the way Locations are edited. A location can't be changed once an item is associated with it, so the only way for a user to "delete" a location is to remove their association from it, not to actually delete the record. Likewise, a location can't be edited once it is a book destination since that would modify the path of the book retroactively, which shouldn't be allowed.
