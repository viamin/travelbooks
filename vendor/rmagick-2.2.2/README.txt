<h2 id="new">What's new?</h2>
RMagick 2.2.2 incorporates all changes and bug fixes from RMagick 1.15.12.
Additionally,

* The installation procedure is pure Ruby.
* The minimum version of Ruby is 1.8.2.
* The minimum version of ImageMagick is 6.3.0.
* GraphicsMagick is not supported.
* The following GraphicsMagick-only methods are no longer available:
Image#grayscale\_pseudo\_class, Image#statistics.
* The following deprecated methods are no longer available:
Image#random\_channel\_threshold, Image#channel\_threshold, Image#montage=,
Image#image\_type=, Image::Info#tile\_info, Image#tile\_info=,
Image::Info#tile, Image::Info#tile=, Image::Info#subimage, Image::Info#subimage=,
Image::Info#subrange, Image::Info#subrange=, Magick.set_monitor.
* The following methods have been added:
Image::Info#stroke=, Image::Info#stroke\_width= and Image::Info#undercolor=,
Draw#fill_pattern= and Draw#stroke\_pattern=, Image#destroy!, Image#destroyed?,
Image#check\_destroyed, Magick.trace\_proc, Image.combine, Image#separate,
Image#distort, Image#each\_pixel.
* Magick::MaxRGB is deprecated (but still available). Use Magick::QuantumRange
instead.
* RMagick works with the Q32 version of ImageMagick.

Various other minor bug fixes and upgrades.

<h2 id="prereq">Prerequisites</h2>

__O/S:__ Linux, Sun Solaris, Cygwin, FreeBSD, OS X.

__Ruby__ 1.8.2 or later. You can get Ruby from <http://www.ruby-lang.org>.

__ImageMagick__ 6.3.0 or later.  You can get ImageMagick from
<http://www.imagemagick.org>.

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

The installation procedure for RMagick 2.2.2 is different from that used
in earlier releases. Before installing RMagick, you must install ImageMagick.
Complete and up-to-date instructions for installing ImageMagick on Linux,
*BSD, and other *nix-type O/S's are available
at <http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-linux.html>, steps 0, 1, 2.
Similarly, instructions for installing ImageMagick using MacPorts
on OS X are available at <http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-osx.html>,
steps 1 and 2. After installing
ImageMagick, use the instructions in the next section to install RMagick.

<h2 id="install">Installing RMagick 2.2.2</h2>

This release of RMagick uses Minero Aoki's setup.rb script for installation.
See the next section for configuration options. Usually you do not need to
specify any of these options. You can get more information about setup.rb from
his web site <http://i.loveruby.net>

I assume you've already decompressed the tarball, or you wouldn't be reading
this. If you have not decompressed the tarball, do so with this command:

    tar xvzf RMagick-2.2.2-tar.gz

or

    tar xvjf RMagick-2.2.2-tar.bz2

Change to the RMagick-2.2.2 directory. If you are not using any
configuration options (usually you don't need to) enter the command

    ruby setup.rb

Note that setup.rb executes all the example programs, so this can take
some time.  This process both builds the example images used in the
documentation and validates your RMagick installation.

After this command completes, make sure you have root priviledges (that
is, login as root or use su or sudo) and enter the command

    ruby setup.rb install

<h4 id="options">Configuration Options</h4>

Type `ruby setup.rb --help` to see a list of configuration options.  In
addition to the regular options, there are a few RMagick-specific options:

* --doc-dir=_directory_
    >  Specify the directory to install the RMagick documentation.
    >  By default this is $prefix/share/RMagick, where $prefix is the
    >  prefix specified by --prefix. For example, to install the
    >  documentation in /Users/me/RMagick, specify:

    >  `./configure --doc-dir=/Users/me/RMagick`

* --allow-example-errors
    >  Normally the documentation installation terminates if 5 examples fail.
    >  If you use this option, the installation does not check for failing
    >  examples and will always complete. This option is useful if you're
    >  having trouble installing RMagick and you want to see all the failing examples.

* --disable-htmldoc
    >  By default the install process runs all the RMagick example programs
    >  and generates HTML versions of all the examples. This option causes
    >  the install process to skip this step. No install verification occurs
    >  and no documentation is installed.

<h2 id="uhoh">Things that can go wrong</h2>

The RMagick installation FAQ [<http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-faq.html>]
has answers to the most commonly reported problems.

#### Can't install RMagick. Can't find libMagick or one of the dependent libraries. Check the mkmf.log file for more detailed information.
Typically this message means that one or more of the libraries that ImageMagick
depends on hasn't been installed. Examine the mkmf.log file in the ext/RMagick
subdirectory of the installation directory for any error messages. These messages
typically contain enough additional information for you to be able to diagnose
the problem. Also see <http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-faq.html#libmagick>.

#### Cannot open shared object file
When make is running the examples, if you get a message like this:

    /home/you/RMagick-2.2.2/lib/RMagick.rb:11:in `require': libMagick.so.0:
      cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory -
      /home/you/RMagick-2.2.2/ext/RMagick/RMagick.so (LoadError)

you probably do not have the directory in which the ImageMagick library
is installed in your load path.  An easy way to fix this is to define
the directory in the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable.  For
example, suppose you installed the ImageMagick library libMagick.so in
/usr/local/lib.  (By default this is where it is installed.) Create the
LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH variable like this:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib

On Linux, see `ld(1)` and `ld.so(8)` for more information. On other operating
systems, see the documentation for the dynamic loading facility.

#### No such file or directory - "/tmp/rmagick6872.6"
When make is running the examples, if you get a message like this:

    hook /home/me/src/RMagick-2.2.2/./post-setup.rb failed:
    No such file or directory - "/tmp/rmagick6872.6"

you probably do not have a temporary directory environment variable set. Set
the TMPDIR environment variable to your temporary directory. For example:

    export TMPDIR=/home/me/tmp

<h2 id="upgrade">Upgrading</h2>

If you upgrade to a newer release of ImageMagick, make sure you're using a
release of RMagick that supports that release. It's safe to install a newer
release of RMagick over an earlier release.

<h2 id="uninstall">Uninstalling</h2>

The `uninstall.rb` script will uninstall RMagick completely. Make sure you
have administrator priviledges. Then run this command:

    ruby uninstall.rb

<h2 id="samples">More samples</h2>

You can find more sample RMagick programs in the /example directory.
These programs are not installed in the RMagick documentation tree.

<h2 id="bugs">Reporting bugs</h2>

Please report bugs in RMagick, its documentation, or its installation
programs to me via the bug tracker on the [RMagick project page at
RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rmagick).  However, I can't help
with Ruby installation and configuration or ImageMagick
installation and configuration. Information about reporting problems and
getting help for ImageMagick is available at the ImageMagick web site
(http://www.imagemagick.org).
