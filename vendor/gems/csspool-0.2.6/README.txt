== Description

CSSpool (pronounced "cesspool") is a validating SAC parser for CSS.  The parser
calls methods on a document handler depending on what it has found. CSSPool
currently only supports CSS 2.1.  CSSPool will not yield invalid properties or
selectors.

== Dependencies

Building CSSpool requires:

  - RACC (not just the runtime)
    (http://i.loveruby.net/en/projects/racc)

  - rubygems, hoe, flexmock

== Examples

=== Tidy a stylesheet

  parser = CSS::SAC::Parser.new
  doc = parser.parse(File.read(ARGV[0]))
  puts doc.to_css

=== Find custom attributes

This example prints out all properties from a particular CSS file.

  class DH < CSS::SAC::DocumentHandler
    def start_selector(selectors)
      puts selectors.map { |x| x.to_css }.join(', ')
    end

    def property(name, value, important)
      puts "#{name} #{value.join(', ')} #{important}"
    end
  end
  
  parser = CSS::SAC::Parser.new(DH.new)
  parser.parse(File.read(ARGV[0]))

See CSS::SAC::DocumentHandler for callbacks to implement.

See SAC[http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/SAC/] for more information on SAC.
